# BrPage Test Case Intent Documentation

## Overview
The BrPage test suite validates the lifecycle management, rendering behavior, and configuration handling of the React BrPage component.

## Test Categories

### Component Initialization 
- **SDK Integration**: Verifies the component properly initializes the SPA SDK with provided configuration
- **CMS Synchronization**: Ensures the page synchronizes with the CMS upon mounting
- **Page Model Override**: Validates that when a page model is provided via props, it's used during SDK initialization

### Component Updates 
- **Props-based Page Updates**: Confirms that when a new page instance is passed via props, the component uses it correctly
- **Configuration Changes**: Tests that configuration updates trigger proper reinitialization, including destroying the old page and creating a new one
- **Lifecycle Management**: Ensures proper cleanup and recreation of page instances during updates

### Component Cleanup 
- **Resource Cleanup**: Verifies the component properly destroys the page instance when unmounting
- **Null Safety**: Ensures no errors occur when attempting to destroy an undefined page instance
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Tests that when a component unmounts during async initialization, the page instance is properly destroyed instead of setting state on an unmounted component

### Rendering Behavior
- **Children Rendering**: Validates that child components are rendered correctly within the BrPage wrapper
- **NBR Mode Handling**: Tests conditional rendering based on NBR (No Bloomreach) mode configuration:
  - With NBR mode disabled: children should not render when no page is available
  - With NBR mode enabled: children should render even without a page instance
- **Effect Execution Timing**: Ensures child component effects run properly during asynchronous page initialization when NBR mode is enabled

## Key Testing Patterns
- **Lifecycle Verification**: Each test ensures proper SDK lifecycle management (initialize → sync → destroy)
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Tests validate various configuration scenarios and edge cases
- **Snapshot Testing**: Visual regression testing for rendered output
- **Asynchronous Behavior**: Proper handling of async SDK operations and their impact on rendering
