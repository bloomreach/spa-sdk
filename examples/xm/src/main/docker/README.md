# brXM SPA Example Project
This Docker image provides an example backend for a JavaScript-based Single Page Application.

## What is Bloomreach Experience Manager?
[Bloomreach Experience Manager](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/products/experience-manager) (brXM) is an open and flexible CMS designed for developers and marketers. As the original headless CMS, brXM allows developers to build quickly and integrate with the systems. While itâ€™s built for speed, it also provides top-notch personalization and channel management capabilities for marketers to drive results.

## Run
### Linux and Windows Hosts
```bash
docker run --net=host bloomreach/xm-spa-example
```

### Docker for Mac
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 bloomreach/xm-spa-example
```

Due to [this](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/68) bug in Docker for Mac, the CMS instance cannot access the SPA port on the host machine.
To get it working, we should update the UrlRewriter [rule](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/library/concepts/spa-integration/url-rewriter-rules.html) to access [`host.docker.internal`](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/) instead of `localhost`:
```xml
<rule>
  <!-- Rule 3: Proxy requests to route to the SPA server -->
  <from>^(?:/[^\/]+)?(?:/_cmsinternal)?([\?/].*)?$</from>
  <to type="proxy" last="true">http://host.docker.internal:3000$0</to>
</rule>
```
