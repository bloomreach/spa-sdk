# React CSR SPA

Example React SPA using the Bloomreach [React SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bloomreach/react-sdk). The app is created
using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install and run

This example is part of a monorepo and other packages will have to be build in order for this example to run. Read more
in the [root README](../../README.md#development) on how to install, build and run the examples.


## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open <http://localhost:3000> to view
it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the
console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React
in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready
to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)
for more information.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the production mode. This will start an express server to serve
the app from the `build` folder. This requires the app to have been build first
by running `npm run build`.
